Steps to run the code:

1. Open the provided Jupyter notebook.
2. Run all the cells sequentially.  If prompted, restart the notebook after running the cell for the "pip installs...".  This is normal and expected.  Continue running the notebook as usual after the restart.
3. The code is organized into sections, allowing multiple cells to be executed together.  These sections include data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
